title: iOS app
description: SwiftUI iPhone and iPad shell. Physical device for BLE and camera Wi-Fi. TestFlight is the public beta.

The production iOS app is a universal iPhone and iPad SwiftUI shell in
`ios/OpenPocketCine/`. It is the operator-proven datalink. Generate the Xcode
project with XcodeGen — see [Setup](../guides/setup/).

## What it does

- Bluetooth pairing, camera Wi-Fi join, saved cameras, reconnect
- HEVC live view on Pocket 4 / 4 Pro; AVC on Osmo Nano
- Scopes, exposure/focus assists, framing tools, customizable DISP chrome.
  Display settings also offer **Streaming Mode** for Osmo Nano: rotate to landscape
  for an uncropped 16:9 full-picture monitor, then tap the image to show or hide
  the compact connection/battery overlay. Tap **Normal Mode** to restore the
  unchanged DISP 1/2 controls.
  Long-press LUT: DJI / Creative / Custom. DJI Auto uses the official Rec.709
  cubes. Creative is Mono / Contrast / Warm / Cool. Exposure compensation is
  −3…+3 at ½ stop before the cube. Auto on a clip reads
  `com.dji.camera.ColorGammaSxS` from the original take (same field Mimo Color
  Recovery uses) — not the 720p LRF sidecar, which is Rec.709 even for log.
  Last live D-Log / D-Log2 is the fallback when that atom is missing —
  `colr`/`nclx` is Rec.709 even for log. Opening LUT on a disconnected clip
  keeps that Auto cube (it does not restamp from a missing live SET).
- Camera writes (record, ISO, EV, zoom, gimbal on Pocket). The gimbal stick
  and zoom chip sit together as a cluster in the trailing-bottom of the
  picture — the same on iPhone and iPad, portrait and landscape. Stick
  pan stays picture-relative. The rotate-180 button inverts pan at the
  end of the rotation (like Mimo). Extra-mirror live view when that 180
  lands and Selfie Flip is off; Flip on skips extra-mirror. The last
  picture stays for a couple of frames before that X-flip so the feed
  does not swap in place. Joystick yaw to 180 does not invert. Reconnect
  while at 180 inverts without another triple-tap. D-Log2 cannot zoom:
  idle hops to D-Log off 1×; while rolling the chip grays and tap/pinch
  toast instead of changing color.
- Media library, playback with LUT / peaking / false colour / zebra on the 720p
  proxy (same present order as live: identity player and Metal are siblings;
  GPU latest-wins, freeze keeps the last frame). Preview LUT grades the
  decoded 420 frame on Metal at 1440 px — not `AVVideoComposition` (that
  path is export bake). LUT replace hides the player once Metal owns the
  picture. Next/prev with LUT on keeps the grade without cycling the chip.
  Auto LUT remembers shot color with the
  cached clip, so it still binds when the camera is disconnected. A **Proxy**
  tag means only the 720p sidecar is on the phone — connect to share the
  original. Storage **Full Resolution Caching** (on by default) also caches
  the original when you open a clip. LUT bake on export can include the
  LUT exposure pull (Bake exposure under Bake LUT; on by default)
- Optional Frame.io Camera to Cloud when you add your own Adobe keys

Verify record start/stop on the camera body until you trust the link.

## Device requirements

BLE, Local Network, and Hotspot Configuration do not work in the Simulator.
Operator-visible UI changes are proven on a **physical** iPhone (and iPad when
the layout is in play). Protocol tests (`just test`) do not need hardware.
iPad hides the system time / battery bar; monitor chrome is the HUD.

Failed physical-device connections show an eight-stage diagnostic from BLE
connect through datalink. The failed row includes the NSError domain, code, and
localized description. In particular, this distinguishes
`NEHotspotConfigurationManager.apply` from DHCP/path verification; an `internal`
Hotspot error alone is recorded as a possible signing-entitlement issue, not
treated as proof and not used to silently change the connection path.

## Releases

Public beta: [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1tmt3aEB). PRs that
change `Sources/`, `ios/`, or `Package.swift` update
`ios/TestFlight/WhatToTest.en-US.txt` for operators. See
[`docs/testflight-ci.md`](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/blob/main/docs/testflight-ci.md).
