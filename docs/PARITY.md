# Operator parity

iOS is the operator-proven baseline. Android matches operator-visible behavior
unless a row lists an exception. GPU backends, Bluetooth stacks, and OS APIs may
diverge. Shipping a one-platform operator-visible change without a row here is
incomplete.

Before changing an operator-visible surface, read this file. Ship both shells or
write the exception in the table in the same PR.

| Surface | Must match | May diverge | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Connection FTUE and spine | BLE → SoftAP → UDP; **enable-once**; ephemeral local port; arm `0x02` on enable write; disconnect drops driver + decoder; session recovery holds last frame | iOS `NEHotspotConfiguration` vs Android `WifiNetworkSpecifier` + `bindProcessToNetwork`; Network.framework vs Android sockets. The AltStore diagnostic build shows iOS-only BLE/pairing/approval/credentials/hotspot/path/datalink stages with NSError domain/code before any Manual Wi-Fi fallback is enabled. | **physical** both; AltStore diagnostics on iPhone |
| Live chrome | DISP 1/2 maps, layout metrics (`LiveDesign` / `fillCrop` / screen-flip pillarbox), picker chrome, record as bottom sheet, zoom chip, gimbal 1–5 gain, stick pan picture-relative (invert pan on rotate-180 at settle, not joystick 180; extra-mirror = TT180 && Selfie Flip off; MIRROR assist XORs), rec lamp `pressShutter`. iPad hides the system time / battery bar (HUD chips stay). Control toast parks under the mounted top bar (DISP 1 / operator-shown status bar) and on the feed edge when that bar is off (DISP 2). | iOS Liquid Glass vs Kyant (API 33+ and ≥4 GB; else solid frost); SF Symbols / Material only where Lucide catalog has not replaced them. Android edge-to-edge keeps a transparent system bar. Both shells GET Selfie Flip pid `0x0038` ~1 Hz on the live UDP ACK pump (untracked; not the shared `0x8E` SET/GET waiter) and echo pktType-`0x03` seq in window-ACK group 1 so those replies do not stall. A keepalive BLE Flip GET fires when UDP replies go stale (≥2 s). | **physical** both |
| Streaming Mode | iOS-only full-picture 16:9 Nano monitor; tap reveals connection, battery, and Normal Mode. Existing DISP 1/2 state is preserved. | Explicit iOS sideload exception for the current Nano streaming workflow; Android retains normal DISP chrome until a matching operator flow is requested. The separate iOS diagnostics target alone exposes diagnostics export and a timed Nano renderer experiment: 12-AU preroll, host-clock 30 fps PTS, and background `sampleBufferRenderer` feed. Neither ships in production. | **physical** iPhone |
| Assists | Toolbar 1:1 (LUT, PEAK, FALSE, ZEBRA, WAVE, PARADE, HISTO, VECTOR, LIGHTS, AUDIO, GUIDES, GRID, CROSS, MIRROR); long-press options; WAVE hold-without-drag opens options; scope plate metrics (`ScopeMiniChrome`) | Metal vs Vulkan vs GLES; Vision vs `android.media.FaceDetector`; PixelCopy / Kyant sampling | **physical** both |
| Camera SETs | `CameraSetMailbox` fire-and-forget + 300 ms retransmit + 2 s settle; missed ACK does not revert HUD; ISO D-Log ↔ D-Log2 hop; audio blobs and tap-focus stay round-trips | JNI vs Swift `fireCamera` | **physical** both |
| Zoom | Chip 1×→3×→6×→12×; `CamFov` hybrid readout; pinch at 20 Hz without ACK wait; D-Log2 hops to D-Log off 1×. While rolling in D-Log2 the chip is gray (0.4, same as lock) but still hittable: tap and pinch toast `Can't change color while recording — D-Log2 can't zoom` and send neither zoom nor color. D-Log / Rec.709 / HLG still zoom while rolling. Idle D-Log2 still hops. | Hit-testing over SurfaceView vs SwiftUI | **physical** both |
| Tracking | Long-press+drag search box `0x02/0xA6`; tap face bracket → ActiveTrack; green cancel X and focus-reset | Face detector implementation | **physical** both |
| Operator Setup | Seven tabs (Link, Sharing, View Assist, Controls, Display, Storage, System); DJI Black; Sora + IBM Plex; NOTICE legal | Frame.io row is “Not configured” until iOS keys exist | **physical** both |
| Media | Camera catalog, SoftAP HTTP cache, 720p LRF/XRF proxy playback, independent playback assist rail, LUT / PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA grade that proxy (identity player + overlay/replace feed), live HEVC held while library covers the monitor. Next/prev keeps the processed-feed host so an armed LUT rebakes the new item without cycling the chip. Shot color lives in the media cache (`color.json`) so Auto LUT works disconnected. **Proxy** tag when only the 720p sidecar is on the phone. Storage **Full Resolution Caching** (on by default) also caches the original on open. Playback LUT replace hides the identity player once the GPU owns the cube (live already does). | Frame.io C2C and LUT bake on export: iOS only. iOS Share **Bake LUT** has **Bake exposure** (on by default) so the LUT exposure pull is written into the file; off keeps the cube at 0.0. Android share/save uses the original (`MediaHTTP.deliveryPath`). Playback chrome is an 82% DJI-black plate (no Kyant). GPU backends: iOS `CIFeedView` vs Android GLES. iOS playback stacks `AVPlayerLayer` and `CIFeedView` as siblings — Metal nested in `AVPlayerLayer` is a black LUT plate. Android playback already matches live: ExoPlayer writes an OES surface and `LiveFeedEffectsSession` grades LUT/FALSE/PEAK/ZEBRA in GLES (`PlaybackFeedView`); TextureView is only the window. | **physical** both |
| Present path | `FeedPresentPolicy`: skip duplicate timestamps, latest-wins bake, freeze ≠ flush (2 s keep last sample), unhide replace-grade before the drawable, offscreen `isEnabled = false`, one `0x09/0xa8` in flight (`SerialSessionGate`) | iOS Metal / `CIFeedView` vs Android GLES `LiveFeedEffectsSession`; debug line is `control-live.log` / logcat, not operator chrome. Extra-mirror commits on the feed host at present (TT180) after holding the last picture 3 frames / 120 ms so the current orientation is not X-flipped in place. | **physical** both |
| Explicit skip | — | VideoToolbox, MetalFX super-res, iOS 26 Liquid Glass API, Frame.io OAuth, LEVEL / De-SQ / MAG | n/a |

Datalink bind, ACK, enable-write, and decoder latch facts live in
[`live-session.md`](live-session.md). Android I/O that implements these rows
lives in [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md). First-run copy and operator voice:
[`UX.md`](UX.md). Live-path SLOs: [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md).

## Chrome metrics

Must match across shells. Do not keep a second copy in `ANDROID.md`.

- View Assist options and capture pickers: 27 dp close, 12 dp pad, 8 dp gap.
- Drum faces 27/20 pt with 0.12/0.88 fade. ISO / shutter / WB drums fill so
  neighbours peek; short menus hug.
- FORMAT and COLOR hang 8 dp under the top-deck chips at 340 dp
  (`LiveTopPickerHost`) and hug — they do not fill to the assist bar.
- LUT 50/50 stays pinned. LUT exposure stepper is −3…+3 at ½ stop,
  input-referred before the cube (ETTR pull). Not camera EV. Playback Auto
  uses clip Keys `com.dji.camera.ColorGammaSxS` on the **original** take
  (D-Log / D-Log2 / Rec.709 / Rec.2100 HLG). LRF/XRF proxies are Rec.709
  even for log — do not read them. A 2 MiB Range of the original tail is
  enough when the 4K file is not cached. Last live log is the fallback when
  the atom is missing. Opening LUT in playback does not restamp Auto from the
  live SET — including disconnected library clips (no camera `inPlayback`
  flag). `nclx` stays Rec.709 for log.
  iOS Share Bake LUT nests Bake exposure (on by default). Share card hugs;
  max height 520 dp so portrait Back stays off the status bar.
- Picker / assist cards add a 0.20 black ND on HUD glass.
- `ScopeMiniChrome`: 0.72 rounded plate, hairline, 16 dp corner, 16 dp shadow.
- Movable scope panel: 0.3 s hold then drag, L-corner 2 dp outside the clip,
  scale 0.6…1.6.
- Histogram gutters 17.5 dp (traffic lamps + 0 / 100), not 17.5 px.
- Zebra stored thresholds stay 0–100 IRE; 0–255 readout is encoded codes via
  `ScopeDisplayScale.signalNative`.
- PStops reference ruler paints EV-domain bands + Min/−3/18%/Skin/+2/Max
  markers, not IRE labels.
- Gimbal cluster: stick + zoom chip (+ reserved gimbal controls) as one
  trailing-bottom parking spot in every orientation. Zoom stacks above the
  stick, trailing-aligned — not glued to record. On width-constrained iPad,
  record sits on the canvas floor: the cluster stays on the right edge and
  lifts above the record button. Follow / speed / A·B·C attach leading of
  the stick later without moving it.
