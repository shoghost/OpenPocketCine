# Live performance budgets

The picture is the product. Chrome, scopes, and SET traffic ride around it.
Target hardware is mid/high-end: iPhone 13-class and newer; Android API 33+
with ≥4 GB RAM (the Kyant glass gate). Prove **physical** after any live-path
change.

Numbers that already have a home stay there. This file is the SLO index and the
rules that are not in those homes. Changing a budget is a code + docs change in
the same PR.

## Budgets

| Surface | Budget | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live picture | Present at the camera’s live rate. Typical Pocket/Nano SoftAP is ~25 fps 720p. Do not pace decode at 30 fps. A 4K 50p body may present 50 Hz 720p. Skip duplicate timestamps; latest-wins if a LUT bake is busy. Runtime grade cap 1440 px (`FeedPresentPolicy.maxWorkingWidth`). | [`live-session.md`](live-session.md), `FeedPresentPolicy` |
| Playback LUT | 720p proxy with the official cube stays at a usable rate on iPhone 13-class (picture first; same class as LUT-off). Native 420 IOSurface → GPU cube at `maxWorkingWidth`. Pull clock follows the display (24–120 Hz); `hasNewPixelBuffer` gates the cube — do not cap the display link at 24. No `AVVideoComposition` for preview. Scope tap stays off the present thread. Android playback is the live GLES session (OES → cube); no TextureView `getBitmap`. | `PlaybackFeedSession`, `PlaybackFeedView` |
| Window ACK | pktType `0x04` at **40 Hz**, three groups: video `0x02` seq, ackedData `0x03` seq, telemetry extra | [`live-session.md`](live-session.md) |
| Live enable | **Enable-once.** Further enables follow the watchdog only | `AGENTS.md`, [`feed-watchdog.md`](feed-watchdog.md) |
| Stall / recover | 2 s UDP silence is a stall; 8 s GOP grace after `0x09/0xa8`; 4 s after an AF-C SET; 5 s between enables; 60 s UDP rebuild backoff | `FeedWatchdog`, [`feed-watchdog.md`](feed-watchdog.md) |
| HUD chrome | 5 Hz (`LiveChromeThrottle.statusInterval` = 0.2 s). REC, format, color, zoom, and the other `isImmediate` fields bypass | `LiveChromeThrottle` |
| Scope tap | 25 Hz with 1–2 scopes, 10 Hz with 3+ (`PocketScopeSampler`). 200-wide downsample (213×120 on 720p SoftAP). Thermal ×3 serious / ×5 critical. A 50 Hz proxy still skips. Assists-off is one blit — no 1280×720 histogram or readback per frame | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) I/O; iOS present path matches the rate |
| HUD glass sample | PixelCopy ~20 Hz when Kyant cannot sample the SurfaceView | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) |
| Zoom pinch | Distinct lens ticks at 20 Hz, no ACK wait | [`PARITY.md`](PARITY.md) |
| Battery | Sticky `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` (Android); no 1 Hz poll | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) |

`NanoArrivalJitterBuffer` holds complete Nano AVC access units in one serial decode-before-playout
queue with a 200 ms target delay. A rolling two-second arrival estimate selects the nominal cadence;
queue-delay feedback shortens or lengthens the next interval by 5 ms outside a ±10 ms deadband.
It assumes neither 25 nor 30 fps, preserves arrival order, and never duplicates frames. Camera source
timestamps remain diagnostics only, so one missing AU does not replay its timestamp hole as an extra
presentation pause. Production and Test then use the same
`onAccessUnit → HevcDecoder → display layer` presentation path. Earlier fixed-rate, decoded-frame,
and future-PTS renderer experiments
remain disconnected from both active routes. Non-Nano live sources remain unbuffered.

## Threading

UDP receive re-arms on the network queue before retained `Data` is handed to the user-initiated
serial datalink processing queue, not after parse, assembly, or a main-actor hop. A busy HUD or
video burst must not stop the socket callback.

Depacketize and scope accumulation stay off the UI thread. Compose/SwiftUI
invalidates at the HUD budget, not per video packet.

Keep the last decoded frame through recover, and across extra-mirror
(3 frames / 120 ms) so TT180 does not X-flip the on-screen picture in
place. Empty samples and
`flushAndRemoveImage` before the next picture are a black well, not a stall.
A 2 s gap with no present is a **freeze** (`FeedPresentPolicy.isFrozen`) —
UDP still alive means do not send `0x09/0xa8`. Skip duplicate timestamps
on the GPU path; if a LUT bake is still in flight, drop to the latest sample.
Runtime grade stays at `FeedPresentPolicy.maxWorkingWidth` (1440 px) on the
720p proxy — do not memcpy a 4K original to apply a cube. Live LUT replace
hides the HEVC layer once Metal owns the picture. Playback does the same:
`AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` pulls Metal-compatible 420 (not 32BGRA),
`LiveAssistEngine` grades on a pull queue, and `CIFeedView` is a **sibling**
of `AVPlayerLayer` under a plain UIView (same stacking as live
`DisplayLayerView`). Nesting `CAMetalLayer` inside `AVPlayerLayer` presents
LUT replace as a black plate; overlay stripes still showed through. Once
Metal owns the cube, hide the player — a second HEVC present under the grade
is the hitch. Overlay (PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA) keeps the identity layer.
Export bake stays `AVVideoComposition`. The cube bakes at feed resolution and
bilinear-fits the panel; Lanczos / MetalFX stay opt-in Quality/AI. The baker
pipelines the next cube while the GPU finishes the last. Next/prev clip does
not recreate the playback `CAMetalLayer` — a slide `.id` rebuild stole the
session and left LUT off until the chip was cycled. Playback Auto reads
2 MiB from the **original** take's tail once per item
(`ClipColorProfile.fileTailBytes`) — never the LRF/XRF sidecar, not the 4K
`mdat`, not per frame. When the original is not cached, that tail is an HTTP
Range.

Offscreen / hidden processed feeds set `isEnabled = false` (no Metal/GLES).
Replace-grade unhides the drawable **before** `nextDrawable`; overlay stays
hidden until the transparent bake lands.

## Hardware

Kyant liquid glass: API 33+ and ≥4 GB, not `isLowRamDevice`. FULL stays FULL —
no frame-budget demote. Older / low-RAM devices stay on solid frost.

Decoder prefers hardware (`c2.qti` / Exynos, VideoToolbox) over a software
fallback. GLES `FeedEffectsGlProgram` is the Android decode fallback when
Vulkan cannot init.

`WIFI_MODE_FULL_LOW_LATENCY` stays on while live.

## When this pointer fires

A live-path, HUD, scope, ACK, playback-LUT, or smoothness change. After the
edit, the row you touched still matches its owner, and the picture is
**physical** at the camera’s live rate on mid/high-end hardware. Playback LUT
on a 720p proxy is the same bar.
